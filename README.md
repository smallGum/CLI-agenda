## Commands Design

Please refer to [cmd-design](./cmd/cmd-design.md)

## Test

At first, there is only one public user `guest`, so let's create some users first

create user1

```shell
$ ./CLI-agenda register -u user1 -p user1
2017/11/02 08:30:21  created successfully
user:user1 created successfully!
```

create user2


```shell
$ ./CLI-agenda register --username=user2 --password=user2
2017/11/02 08:30:42  created successfully
user:user2 created successfully!

```

when you want create a user with existed user name, you will get

```
./CLI-agenda register -u user1 -p 123456
2017/11/01 18:00:15 this username has been occupied
```

now list all users, guest user has no access to this.

```
$ ./CLI-agenda users
there are 3  users:
--------------------------
2017/11/02 08:30:49 only users loged in have access to this
```

so we have to login first

```
$ ./CLI-agenda login -u user1 -p user1
2017/11/02 08:31:08  log in successfully
user:user1 log in successfully
```

then

```
$ ./CLI-agenda usersthere are 3  users:
--------------------------
user:user2
email:
tel:
--------------------------
user:guest
email:
tel:
--------------------------
user:user1
email:
tel:
--------------------------
```

user1 logout

```
$ ./CLI-agenda logout
2017/11/02 08:31:43  log out
now you are a guest
```
user2 login

```
$ ./CLI-agenda login --username=user2 --password=user2
2017/11/02 08:32:47  log in successfully
user:user2 log in successfully
```

set user2's telephone numbe and email
```
$ ./CLI-agenda setTel -t 15521165845
2017/11/02 08:33:33  set telephone to be 15521165845
```
```
$ ./CLI-agenda setEmail -e 123456@qq.com
2017/11/02 08:33:49  set email to be 123456@qq.com
```
and list users again to see result

```
$ ./CLI-agenda users
there are 3  users:
--------------------------
user:guest
email:
tel:
--------------------------
user:user1
email:
tel:
--------------------------
user:user2
email:123456@qq.com
tel:15521165845
--------------------------
```
cancel user2's account

```
$ ./CLI-agenda cancelUser
2017/11/02 08:34:17 cancel its account
```

and list users again to ensure user2 has been canceled
```
$ ./CLI-agenda users
there are 2  users:
--------------------------
2017/11/02 08:34:31 only users loged in have access to this
```
```
$ ./CLI-agenda login -u user1 -p user1
2017/11/02 08:34:45  log in successfully
user:user1 log in successfully
```
```
$ ./CLI-agenda users
there are 2  users:
--------------------------
user:guest
email:
tel:
--------------------------
user:user1
email:
tel:
--------------------------
```

Now we test about meeting operations. First we create three users:

```
./CLI-agenda users
there are 4  users:
--------------------------
user:guest
email:
tel:
--------------------------
user:user1
email:
tel:
--------------------------
user:Alice
email:
tel:
--------------------------
user:Bob
email:
tel:
--------------------------
```

create two new meetings:

```
./CLI-agenda createMeeting -t "Season You Like" -p Alice+Bob -s 2017-07-12 -e 2017-07-15
2017/11/01 18:08:46 successfully create a new meeting "Season You Like".

./CLI-agenda logout
2017/11/01 18:18:41  log out
now you are a guest

./CLI-agenda login -u Alice -p 123456
2017/11/01 18:19:00  log in successfully
user:Alice log in successfully

./CLI-agenda createMeeting -t "How to Cook" -p user1 -s 2017-07-08 -e 2017-07-12
2017/11/01 18:19:50 successfully create a new meeting "How to Cook".
```

query one's meetings:

```
./CLI-agenda queryMeetings -s 2017-07-08 -e 2017-07-13
